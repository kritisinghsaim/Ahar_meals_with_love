			<p>Ahar is a food recovery and food waste management network that helps connect the individuals and businesses with excess food to people in need. We approach the issue of hunger with a sharing-economy model: the donation of excess food enables a vital, yet often wasted, resource to be used to its full capacity.</p>
<p>Ahar is an edible food Recovery Project which serves the surplus excess foods from Weddings , Parties , and other events, to the hungry and deprived. This is achieved through a Hot- line number in the City along with a dedicated collection Mini Van. The system works thus. Once we receive a call or pickup request from the donor at our hotline number or in website, we reach the respective collection point with our volunteers and necessary accessories depending on the volume of food along with our &#8220;AHAR RATH&#8221;, a vehicle specially equipped by our team for excess food collection.</p>
<p>We have also reached out to more than 50,000 students teaching them auditing food waste and managing food waste in their campuses. Awareness sessions on the impact of food waste is conducted in corporates , organisations , institutions and public places.</p>
<p>Ahar Project Feeds 500 hungry people daily in Ranchi city. New City chapters are started in Patna, Uttar Pradesh and Salem which feeds 1000 people per month average. Till now we have fed 60,000 people with the good quality untouched excess foods recovered from different functions</p>

			<p>It just started with 2 Shopper Bags and a volunteer to collect the surplus food and deliver to the homeless through Public Transportation System from January 06th , 2018.</p>
<p>Today, Ahar matches the individuals and users who have surplus food with nearby shelters, organizations, and low income communities in real time. We also have a dedicated Call Center, Collection Vehicle , Feeding Points and a sustainable Process in Place. We believe the answer to global hunger starts locally, with a secure, collaborative peer-to-peer approach.</p>

			<p>Throwing away food benefits no one. Not only could the food have gone to someone in need, but the resource cost is tremendous: one-fifth of greenhouse gases come from meat production, and it takes over ten gallons of water to produce a single slice of bread. Our platform simplifies the process of food recovery, so Donors can make social, environmental and financial change in their choice to Feed the Need.</p>
<p>Just because it&#8217;s easier doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s better! There are tons of people out there in need of a meal, and by giving to them rather than the trashcan, you are building up some major good karma.On top of that, you’ll be improving the environment and providing people with meaningful work: it’s an easy way for corporates and businesses to give back to their community.</p>

<p>The Major expenses involved in are for Transportation and Communication. You can get connected with us to have our monthly / yearly expense report.</p>
<p>You can donate for the cause using the link available in the website. We have a admin panel which is logged on daily to update the impact on number of people benefited along with the expenses made. The Transparency reports will be available for all donors and supporters..</p>

			<p><strong>India is the second largest food producer covering 10.04% of the total World’s food production</strong>. But, at the same time <strong>India ranked 97 among 118 developing countries</strong> for which the <strong>Global Hunger Index (GHI)</strong> was calculated in 2016.</p>
<p>Basing its readings on the most recent data, the 2016 GHI for India was derived from the fact that an estimated <strong>15% population is undernourished</strong>, lacking in adequate food intake, both in quantity and quality.</p>
<p>The share of <strong>under-5 children</strong> who are <strong>`wasted&#8217; is about 15%</strong> while the share of children who are <strong>`stunted&#8217; is a staggering 39%.</strong> This reflects widespread and chronic lack of balanced food. The <strong>under-5 mortality rate is 4.8%</strong> in India, partially reflecting the fatal synergy of inadequate nutrition and unhealthy environments.</p>
<p>Roughly one third of the food produced in the world for human consumption every year approximately <strong>1.3 billion tonnes gets lost or wasted</strong>. Food losses and waste amounts to roughly <strong>US$ 680 billion in industrialized countries and US$ 310 billion in developing countries.</strong></p>
